I'm a software engineer who can't stop building things. By day I'm a Senior Engineer at **The Trade Desk**, working on adtech at scale. By night I'm usually yelling at Claude Code, wiring up AI agents, or convincing myself that *this* side project is the one.

## The origin story

I used to be a musician. Punk rock, jazz, the whole thing. In 2015 I traded guitar picks for semicolons and never looked back. Taught myself to code, got obsessed, and eventually started teaching others — I was a **software engineering lecturer at BrainStation** in London, helping career-changers make the same leap I did.

## What I'm into right now

- **AI tooling** — I'm borderline obsessed. Claude, Claude Code, OpenClaw, cursor, building agents, automating everything. If it can think, I want to make it think *for me*.
- **Deepflow** — my startup. A focus timer app for people who actually want to do deep work, not just read about it.
- **Protocols** — I treat my life like a system. Morning protocol, workout protocol, sleep protocol. If it's not documented, it doesn't exist. I'm slowly publishing all of them here.
- **Salsa dancing** — Mon/Wed/Sat. It's the one thing that makes my brain fully shut up.
- **Lifting** — Daily hypertrophy training because I want to be the old guy who can still open jars.

## The blog

I write about things I'm actually learning — not hot takes for engagement. Software engineering, productivity systems, deep work, AI tools, and occasionally a book that rewired my brain. If I can't explain it, I don't understand it yet.

## The vibe

I believe in building over talking, systems over willpower, and shipping over perfecting. I'm deeply allergic to corporate fluff and motivational LinkedIn posts. If you're here, you probably are too.

Let's build something.
