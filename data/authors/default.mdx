I'm a software engineer who can't stop building things. By day I'm a Senior Engineer at **The Trade Desk**. By night I'm usually yelling at Claude Code, wiring up AI agents, or convincing myself that _this_ side project is the one.

## The origin story

I grew up in **Guatemala**, where I picked up a guitar and decided that music was my entire personality. That conviction carried me to **Madrid** and then **Australia**, where I studied sound engineering and music — because apparently one country wasn't enough to figure out that being a rockstar wasn't paying the bills.

Eventually I landed in **London**, where I had a plot twist: I fell in love with code. Did a coding bootcamp, got hooked, then went full send and completed a **Master's in Computer Science**. Somewhere along the way I stopped writing songs and started writing functions. The debugging is surprisingly similar.

London became home for years — I built a career in software, started **teaching software engineering at BrainStation** (helping career-changers make the same leap I did), and discovered that explaining things is just as fun as building them.

Then in **2025**, because I hadn't lived in enough countries yet, I moved to **New York City**. Brooklyn, specifically. Still building, still teaching, still occasionally picking up the guitar when nobody's listening.

Four countries, two careers, one increasingly chaotic desk.
