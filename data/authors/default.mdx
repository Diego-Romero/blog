I'm a software engineer who can't stop building things. By day I'm a Senior Engineer at **The Trade Desk**. By night I'm usually yelling at Claude Code, wiring up AI agents, or convincing myself that *this* side project is the one.

## The origin story

I grew up in **Guatemala**, where I picked up a guitar and decided that music was my entire personality. That conviction carried me to **Madrid** and then **Australia**, where I studied sound engineering and music — because apparently one country wasn't enough to figure out that being a rockstar wasn't paying the bills.

Eventually I landed in **London**, where I had a plot twist: I fell in love with code. Did a coding bootcamp, got hooked, then went full send and completed a **Master's in Computer Science**. Somewhere along the way I stopped writing songs and started writing functions. The debugging is surprisingly similar.

London became home for years — I built a career in software, started **teaching software engineering at BrainStation** (helping career-changers make the same leap I did), and discovered that explaining things is just as fun as building them.

Then in **2025**, because I hadn't lived in enough countries yet, I moved to **New York City**. Brooklyn, specifically. Still building, still teaching, still occasionally picking up the guitar when nobody's listening.

## What I'm into right now

- **AI tooling** — I'm borderline obsessed. Claude, Claude Code, OpenClaw, Cursor, building agents, automating everything. If it can think, I want to make it think *for me*.
- **Deepflow** — my startup. A focus timer app for people who actually want to do deep work, not just read about it.
- **Protocols** — I treat my life like a system. Morning protocol, workout protocol, sleep protocol. If it's not documented, it doesn't exist. I'm slowly publishing all of them here.
- **Teaching** — Whether it's a bootcamp classroom or a blog post, I genuinely love breaking things down. If I can't explain it, I don't understand it yet.
- **Salsa dancing** — Mon/Wed/Sat. It's the one thing that makes my brain fully shut up.
- **Lifting** — Daily hypertrophy training because I want to be the old guy who can still open jars.

## The blog

I write about things I'm actually learning — not hot takes for engagement. Software engineering, productivity systems, deep work, AI tools, and occasionally a book that rewired my brain.

## The vibe

I believe in building over talking, systems over willpower, and shipping over perfecting. I'm deeply allergic to corporate fluff and motivational LinkedIn posts. If you're here, you probably are too.

Four countries, two careers, one increasingly chaotic desk. Let's build something.
